KNOWN BUGS:

2. (feature) legend doesn't include datasets in order of occurence in JSON, but rather in order of mark_style and line_style. Or, perhaps, it just does whatever. I don't really know [found: 2022-06-23]

2023-02-23:
-when using scale='log' on y-axis and then minor_grid_on='True', minor grids do NOT show in the plot
-->This need to use plt.semilogy(), or plt.loglog(), instead of setting scale to log. 






FIXED BUGS:

0. set_decimalComma_with_precision disrupted 'log'-scale exponent [found: 2022-06-21, fixed: 2022-06-23]
1. cannot invert axis when it is scale 'log', regardless of order of function-calling [found: 2022-06-23, fixed: 2022-06-23]
