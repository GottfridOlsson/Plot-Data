## Plot-Data

Plots data from CSV-file.

Settings specified in JSON-file.

This is a work in progress. A HOW-TO will be written in the future. For now, look at a JSON-file and figure it out yourself ;)


2022-12-28:
STANDARD_VALUES_ERRORBAR.json now contains all values that could be changed as of now.
A list should be compiled over these values and the 'tree' (layers/indentation in JSON) of how to write them in.

TODO: create a template (json) with minimal required things you HAVE to declare to produce a figure
TODO: create a minimal-actually-useful template (json) with the most common things you want to change (x-/y-label, CSV_column_x/_y, ...)
